# Sindian: The Family Tree Web App

Sindian is a web application that enables users to create and maintain their own family tree. Users can share their tree with all their family (and extended family) members to expand and add more information to the tree. The tree can serve as an invaluable source of information about the family ancestory and current members.

Featuring an intuitive and easy way to create a tree, add and browse members, Sindian is a must for any large family who wishes to record their family members and revisit it anytime through any web browser. They can even search their family by names to find out more about a person and his closest relations.
